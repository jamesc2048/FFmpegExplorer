GUI:

Add Input file
Once file is added, one can click "customise input file"/"details". Per-input file options are revealed (stream seek etc)
There is a "preview" window for this to help choose crop, duration etc. Maybe appears after option is selected.
Options are sorted by "commonness" (stream seek duration first, crop, less common options...

Add Output file
Once file is added, one can click "customise output file". Per-output file options are revealed (codec, stream seek etc)
Options are sorted by "commonness" (stream seek duration first, crop, less common options...

Add Video filter from dropdown. Only allowed filters are in dropdown. Maybe disallowed are greyed out.
Choose video filter.
Verify compatibility of filter (audio, video, data etc)
A preview of the filter's effects is done (maybe? do short encode in background? single frame?)

In simple mode, only one input and output can be chosen. Only simple filters can be chosen, but allow chaining.
Pipeline is strictly input -> filters ... -> output
In complex mode, multiple input-output can be chosen. Complex filter gets validated for number of inputs (e.g. hstack=inputs=n_inputs)
For each complex filter entry, if it takes an input, a corresponding input can be chosen. A previous filter output can be used as an input.
Something like:
Input/inputs (dropdown? maybe "add input" button?) -> filter (filter autoadjusted for n inputs) -> outputs
Outputs can be labels (then can be fed into other filters) Maybe call "Filter chain#1" etc? "Filter input #1"?
Or, outputs can be output video files, selected above.
Maybe... Consider "graph" drawing such as Blender shader graph, but with filters.

Maybe make an exception for simple "complex" scenarios like hstack, crop, etc? Those are useful outside of complex mode.

Once one has decided the pipeline, one can save this operation as a "Preset". Maybe provide premade presets for common ops?
Then, one can use the preset to batch encode. Select files, folder, enqueue, encode...
Also provide way to do one off stuff. Maybe enqueue anyway, so one can do many one-offs at once.
How to do batch encoding of complex filters? Maybe rely on naming convention? txt file list?
